## compare build tools

This is a repo demonstrating the difference of a few build tools, namely: Rake, Ant, Gulp, SBT

## Goal

The build tool should:

1- Concatenate all the files.
2- uglify the result.
3- dump everything in a `.js` file
4- Name the file the result of `whoami` command in the command line at the time of build.
5- Put the file in the build folder.
